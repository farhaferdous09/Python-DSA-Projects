For instance, if $n_I$ = 0, then $n_E$ = 2$n_I$ + 1 = 1. Here we are saying that if there are no internal nodes, or $n_I$ = 0, then we only have 1 external node which is the result of the equation.

We can check this by plugging it into the equation, so 3 = 2$n_i$ + 1, and we plug in 1 for $n_i$ because we said 1 internal node would output 3 external nodes so 3 = 2(1) + 1 which is TRUE.
