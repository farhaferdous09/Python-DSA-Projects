        "> **Answer**: The worst-case sequence for insertion sort is reverse sorted order. For instance, you have an array where every element is less than the element to its left. Every time *insert* is called in this case, every element in the subarray would have to slide one position to the right. For every element to be less than the element to its left, it would mean the array would have to be in reverse sorted order. So if there is an array which is [1,2,3,4,5], its reverse sorted order would be [5,4,3,2,1].\n",

        "In the normal scenario (least-to-greatest priority queue), the running time of insertion-sort would be O(n) since you are just adding in element which is already less than the first element. However, since we have reversed the order in the priority queue for the worst-case sequence, every element is less than every element to its left so the running-time of unsertion sort is O($n^2$) because upon every call to insert, the value inserted is less than every element to its left in the subarray (k=1, k=2, k=3,....,k=n-1) so the total time spent inserting into sorted reverse sorted subarrays is c$n^2$/2 - cn/2. Discard cn/2 because it is a lower term, and the constants c and 1/2 from c$n^2$/2 which leaves us with $n^2$."
