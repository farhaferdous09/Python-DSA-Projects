        "A. All three of the operations in BST (searching, insertion, deletion) have a worst case complexity of O(n), or O(h) where h is the height of BST. For searching, we have to traverse all elements in the tree. For insertion, we need to traverse all elements in order to insert a new element at a certain spot. For deletion, we also need to traverse through all the elements to find the certain one we want to delete. **Because we need to traverse through the tree for all BST operations, this is why the worst-case height is O(h).**\n",
        "\n",
        "B. For AVL, the difference between the height of the left sub tree and the right subtree of any node can't be more than 1. **For all three operations in AVL, the worst-case complexity is O(logn) when traversing through the tree.**\n",
        "\n",
        "C. A splay tree is a type of BST with the property that recently accessed elements are quick to access again. It has the normal operations of a BST in time O(logn), combined with the operation of splaying where the tree is rearranged so that a certain element is placed at the root of the tree. **The worst case height for splay tree is O(n), with the average being O(logn).**\n",
        "\n",
        "D. In a 2-4 tree, the nodes can have anywhere from 2 to 4 children. The tree operates as a search tree and is full at all times. In the worst case where the tree is as high as possible, all nodes are 2-nodes (which is also a binary tree). **Because the tree is height-balanced, the height of the tree is O(logn).**\n",
        "\n",
        "E. A red-black tree is also another BST where all nodes have the extra property of color. The root is black, the external nodes are dummy nodes with no elements and are black, the children of red nodes are always black, and all the external nodes have the same black depth where depth is the number of black ancestors of that node. The height of a red-black tree is O(logn). The black depth of the tree is O(logn$_b$) where n$_b$ is the number of black nodes. In the worst case, there must be a path from the root to a leaf, but since the number of black nodes on that long path is limited to O(logn$_b$), the way to make it longer is to have many red nodes. Red nodes cannot have red children, so in the worst case the number of nodes on that must path must alternate between red and black. So that path is twice as long as the black depth of the tree. **So the worst case height of the tree is O(2logn$_b$).**\n"

If p is red, it directly indicates that p is a red leaf since red nodes can't have children according to the property that the children of red nodes are always black. Deleting a red leaf node doesn't require restructuring the tree since red nodes don't have children. If p is black, its 0 children imply that p is a black leaf node. Deleting a black leaf node results in having to rebalance the tree. The sibling must exist and be a black leaf node, since all external nodes have the same black depth, where black depth is defined as the number of black ancestors of that node. So regardles of p's color, the deleted node is always a read leaf."
